Other things to note  
Plan for your rural stay accordingly as access to grocery stores might not be as immediate as in urban areas. Don't forget to bring necessary items such as groceries, charcoal \& lighter fluid for grilling, firewood for the fire pit and other personal supplies you may need for your remote stay. Closest stores are about 25 minutes away.  

The Dry Frio River located nearby is not to be confused with the very well visited Frio River. Our area does not carry enough water to float down the river. A dry riverbed is a river channel with no river. The water has stopped flowing.   

Due to the location, your wireless service provider maybe unavailable. We advise you take note or print Welcoming message sent prior to stay. We offer Wi\-Fi service at our rental, where you may be able to make Wi\-Fi phone calls/text through different messaging apps.  

This area has no night lights or limited lighting, consider this as you plan your time of arrival.  

As part of the outdoors, be aware of Texas native critters and other hazards that can present themselves in a natural environment. Common critters include but not limited to: mosquitos, spiders, chiggers \& scorpions. Consider packing your preferred bug spray and after bite relief for your trip.   

Last but not least, deer, rabbits, squirrels, turkey, owls and other amazing wildlife are among the commonly seen in this area. Kindly refrain from feeding the wildlife.Show moreWhere you'll sleep

Blanco, TexasRating, 4 stars,  · July 2024,  · Stayed with kidsWe had such a nice stay at Concan Hideaway. There was plenty of room for my 3 children upstairs in the loft. We loved seeing the wildlife around the cabin in the evenings. Hosts included lots of little touches around the house to make you feel at home. The house was about 30 minutes from Concan, but we enjoyed the privacy and seclusion.Show moreShow all 17 reviewsWhere you’ll be
